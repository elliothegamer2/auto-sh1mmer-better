# auto-sh1mmer-better

use linux if it fails during the building process not my problem

## Auto Download a shim 
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/elliothegamer2/auto-sh1mmer-better
  cd auto-sh1mmer-better
  ```
  
  ```bash
  chmod a+x shim.sh
  ```
  
  ```bash
  ./shim.sh <board>
  ```
  so for an octopus board would look like this
  
  ```bash
  ./shim.sh octopus
  ```
